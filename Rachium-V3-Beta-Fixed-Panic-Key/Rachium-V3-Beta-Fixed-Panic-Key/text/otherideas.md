# Proxy Browser with Google Custom Search API - Roadmap

## Overview
This project will replace the current Google search functionality (which scrapes Google search results) with the **Google Custom Search API**. By using the API, the proxy will be able to fetch search results directly from Google in a structured and reliable manner, avoiding issues with scraping and CORS. The goal is to provide users with a better, more efficient search experience, while adhering to Google's API usage guidelines.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Setup Google Custom Search API

#### 1. **Create Google Custom Search Engine (CSE)**
   - Go to the [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/) page.
   - Create a new custom search engine.
     - Configure the search engine to search the entire web (not just specific sites).
   - Note the **Search Engine ID (CX)** for the CSE. This will be needed for API requests.

#### 2. **Obtain API Key**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project (if you donâ€™t have one already).
   - Enable the **Custom Search API** in the Google Cloud Console.
   - Generate an **API key** that will allow your server to make requests to the Google Custom Search API.

   **Goal**: Obtain a **Search Engine ID** and **API Key** from Google to use in your backend requests.

### Phase 2: Integrate Google Custom Search API into Backend

#### 1. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Install the necessary Node.js libraries to make HTTP requests. For example, `axios` for sending API requests.
   ```bash
   npm install axios
