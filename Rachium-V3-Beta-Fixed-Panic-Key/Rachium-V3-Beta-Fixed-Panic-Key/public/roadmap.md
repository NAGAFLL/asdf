# Proxy Browser with Tabs - Roadmap

## Overview
The goal of this project is to extend your current proxy browser by adding a tabbed interface. This will allow users to open multiple websites in separate tabs without the need to press the back button to return to the home page. Each tab will have its own URL input and content display area. The `index.html` page will act as the new tab page, where users can open and manage their tabs.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Add Tabbed Interface to Frontend

#### 1. **HTML Layout Update**
   - Modify the current HTML layout to introduce a **tab container** at the top of the page.
   - Each tab should have its own URL input field and content area to display the fetched content.

   **Goal**: Create a container where tabs can be dynamically added, and each tab will display its content below it.

#### 2. **Create Tab Management System**
   - Allow users to **create new tabs** dynamically.
   - Implement logic to switch between tabs when clicked, so each tab has its own view (content area).

   **Goal**: Each tab should represent a separate browsing session, with the user able to switch between tabs and load different URLs.

#### 3. **Tab State Management**
   - When switching between tabs, make sure to only show the content of the **active tab**.
   - Keep track of which tab is currently active and apply styles accordingly (e.g., changing the tab color).

### Phase 2: Integrate Proxy Functionality into Tabs

#### 1. **URL Input Per Tab**
   - Modify the frontend to have a **URL input field** for each tab.
   - The input field should be used to enter a URL for the proxy request.

   **Goal**: Each tab should have its own URL input field, and users can enter a new URL without affecting other open tabs.

#### 2. **Proxy Requests Per Tab**
   - When the user enters a URL and clicks **Load**, send a request to the backend’s `/proxy` route for that tab.
   - Display the content fetched by the proxy inside the respective tab’s content area.

   **Goal**: The backend should handle proxying separately for each tab, and the corresponding tab should display the fetched content.

#### 3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**
   - If an error occurs when fetching content (e.g., invalid URL, network failure), display an error message inside the tab’s content area.

   **Goal**: Show user-friendly error messages for failed proxy requests.

### Phase 3: Tab Management Features

#### 1. **Close Tabs**
   - Implement a **close button** for each tab so that users can remove tabs they no longer need.
   - When a tab is closed, the active tab should switch to another open tab automatically.

   **Goal**: Allow the user to remove tabs and ensure the UI behaves smoothly when a tab is closed.

#### 2. **Tab Switching**
   - Clicking on a tab should **activate** that tab and display the content associated with it.
   - Deactivate any previously active tab to hide its content.

   **Goal**: Enable smooth switching between tabs without reloading the page.

---

### Phase 4: Final Testing and Debugging

#### 1. **Test Tab Functionality**
   - Test the ability to create, switch, and close tabs.
   - Test loading different URLs in different tabs.

#### 2. **Test Proxy Requests**
   - Ensure that the proxy functionality works as expected and returns the correct content for each URL.
   - Handle edge cases (e.g., invalid URLs, slow networks, errors from the backend).

#### 3. **Fix Bugs**
   - Address any bugs discovered during testing.
   - Make any necessary fixes to ensure everything functions correctly.
